# Medical Image Segmentation Application

This project is a Java application that uses computer vision algorithms and image processing techniques to segment medical images and detect brain tumors quickly and accurately. The app is designed to be used by doctors to segment MRI images and it includes tools for manual annotation and review that allow doctors to check the processed segments before applying them in practice.

## Introduction
This application is a tool for segmenting medical images. It is intended for use by doctors to detect brain tumors in MRI images. The app uses thresholding technique to segment the image automatically, and it allows the user to adjust settings or parameters such as thresholding, noise reduction, etc. The app also includes tools for manual annotation and review that allow doctors to check the processed segments before applying them in practice.

## Requirements
To run this application, you need the following requirements:
- Java 8 or higher
- ORACLE database
- OpenCV library
- JavaFX library
- Oracle JDBC

## Installation
To install the application, follow these steps:
1. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Put your own ORACLE username and password (in the DBUtils class).
4. Compile the source code using your preferred Java IDE.

## Usage
After compiling the code and running the application, follow these steps to use the app:
1. Enter your login credentials or sign up for a new account.
2. Once you are logged in, the app will direct you to the welcome window where you can see helpful information on how to use the app and what features it offers.
3. Click the "Upload an Image" button to choose the MRI image you want to work with.
4. After selecting an image, you will be directed to the automatic segmentation window where you can adjust settings or parameters as needed.
5. If the automatic segmentation doesn't produce the desired results, you can manually segment the image by clicking on the "Manual Segmentation" button and adjust the slider to get the optimal levels that give you the desired results.
6. Once the image is successfully segmented, save it as usual and store it in your PC for easy access later.
